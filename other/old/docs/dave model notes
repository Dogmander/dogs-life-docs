Header - 12 bytes:

0x00    Short    Always seems to be 0xFFFF
0x02    UShort    Number of face sections in this mesh
0x04    UShort    Number of total face entries
0x06    UShort    Number of vertices
0x08    UInt    Always seems to be 0x0000411c

Next follows a table of face sections - 1 UShort per entry.  This is the number of face indices in each part.  They should add up to the total number of face entries in the header.

Then follows the actual face index data - 1 Short per index value

Then follows the vertex data - 0x34 bytes per entry as follows:

* NOTE: Sometimes there is an extra 2 bytes before the vertex data starts - it doesn't seem to be for alignment purposes, so not sure how to calculate it automatically.
