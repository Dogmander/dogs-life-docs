Multiple types of OVL exist in Dog's Life, each with slightly different formats and uses.

Localization OVL:

These are OVL files used for different languages in the game. 
The filename of these define what language and parent OVL they are for. 
The filename layout is as followed:
(Parent OVL #)l(Language #).ovl
A similar format to this also exists, which has a d after the parent OVL number. The purpose and use of these are unknown, as most files which are in this format do not contain any data.
This format is as followed:
(Parent OVL #)d(#)l(Language #).ovl
